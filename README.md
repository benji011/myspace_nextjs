# An unofficial Myspace clone (circa 2002)

<img src="public/images/myspace_nextjs.png"/>

An unofficial MySpace clone of the original from 2002 (when social media platforms were actually about friends). This is an open sourced project I decided to do for fun. Myspace (circa 2002) was bootstrapped with the starter Next.js template. To understand how this app works, please refern to [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) before you start.

The original styles and layout was originally forked from [wittenbrocks tom-myspace-page](https://wittenbrock.github.io/toms-myspace-page). Please send him some love.


## Installation

Fork the repository then clone it to your own machine in a directory you will remember. Then `cd` into it to install dependencies with `npm`

```bash
git clone git@github.com:benji011/myspace_nextjs.git
cd myspace_nextjs
npm install

```

## Running locally
Just run the below command and open `localhost:3000` in your browser
